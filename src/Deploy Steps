Certainly! Deploying a Create React App project to GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` package involves a few steps. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install `gh-pages` Package:**
   If you haven't already, install the `gh-pages` package as a development dependency in your project. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory, then run the following command:

   ```sh
   npm install gh-pages --save-dev
   ```

2. **Set `"homepage"` in `package.json`:**
   Open your `package.json` file and add a `"homepage"` field with the URL where your app will be hosted. For example:

   ```json
   "homepage": "https://username.github.io/repository-name",
   ```

   Replace `username` with your GitHub username and `repository-name` with the name of your repository.

3. **Create a `deploy` Script:**
   In your `package.json`, add a `deploy` script that uses the `gh-pages` command-line tool to deploy your app. Here's an example:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "react-scripts start",
     "build": "react-scripts build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   }
   ```

   The `-d build` flag tells `gh-pages` to deploy the content from the `build` directory.

4. **Build and Deploy:**
   In your terminal, run the following command to build your app:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

   Once the build is complete, run the `deploy` script:

   ```sh
   npm run deploy
   ```

   This will deploy your app to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.

5. **Configure GitHub Repository Settings:**
   In your GitHub repository, go to the "Settings" tab. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section. Set the source branch to `gh-pages` and the root directory to `/root`. Save the changes.

6. **Access Your Deployed App:**
   After a few moments, your app should be accessible at the URL you specified in the `"homepage"` field. It might take a few minutes for changes to propagate.

Remember to replace `username` and `repository-name` with your actual GitHub username and repository name. Following these steps should help you successfully deploy your Create React App project to GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` package.
